## AWS Critical Thinking Project: Modernizing Infrastructure for an E-commerce Startup
Project Overview
In this project, we will evaluate AWS Lambda and AWS Elastic Beanstalk as hosting solutions for a small e-commerce startup's website. The goal is to deploy an existing website onto both platforms, analyze their performance and scalability, and provide recommendations based on cost implications and operational efficiency.

# Project Goals

 ### 1. Research and Obtain a Sample Website:

## Find a simple static website template that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
### 2. Deploy the Website on AWS Lambda:

Set up an AWS Lambda function to host the website.
### 3. Deploy the Website on Elastic Beanstalk:

Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the same website.
### 4. Performance and Scalability Comparison:

Monitor and compare the performance and scalability of both deployments.
### 5. Cost Analysis:

Analyze the cost implications of using AWS Lambda versus Elastic Beanstalk.
 ### 6. Resource Cleanup:

Ensure that all resources are deleted after the project is complete.
### 7. Documentation:

Document the entire project in markdown format and create a GitHub repository to store the documentation.

## Step 1: Obtain a Sample Website
Template Source : Use a simple static website template, such as one from HTML5UP or Bootstrap.

Files Included: Ensure the template includes:
index.html
CSS files
JavaScript files
Directory Structure:
bash
Copy code
/sample-website
├── index.html
├── css
│   └── styles.css
└── js
    └── script.js
## Step 2: Deploy on AWS Lambda
Set Up AWS Lambda:

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to Lambda.
Create a new Lambda function.
Choose the "Author from scratch" option and configure the function name, runtime (Node.js), and permissions.
Configure API Gateway:

Set up API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.
Create a new API, define a resource, and connect it to the Lambda function.
Upload Website Files:

Package your website files (HTML, CSS, JS) into a ZIP file.
Update the Lambda function to serve static files. You can use a package like serverless-http to help serve the static files.
Test the Deployment:

Access the API Gateway endpoint to verify that the website is live.
## Step 3: Deploy on Elastic Beanstalk
Set Up Elastic Beanstalk:

Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new application and environment. Choose "Web server environment" and select the platform (Node.js or PHP, depending on your stack).
Upload Website Files:

Zip the same website files and upload them to Elastic Beanstalk during the environment creation process.
Monitor Deployment:

Wait for Elastic Beanstalk to launch the environment and verify the website is accessible via the provided URL.

## Step 4: Performance and Scalability Comparison
Monitoring Tools: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor metrics such as:
Request count
Latency
Errors
Load Testing: Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate traffic and evaluate how each solution handles scaling.

## Step 5: Cost Analysis
AWS Lambda Costs:

Calculate costs based on:
Number of requests
Duration (time taken to execute the function)
Use the AWS Pricing Calculator for accurate estimates.
Elastic Beanstalk Costs:

Calculate costs based on:
EC2 instance types and hours of usage
Data transfer costs
Again, use the AWS Pricing Calculator for details.

## Step 6: Resource Cleanup
Delete Resources:
Ensure that all AWS resources created for this project (Lambda functions, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk environments, etc.) are deleted to avoid ongoing costs.

## Step 7: Documentation
Create a Markdown File: Document each step of the process, including:
Code snippets
Configuration screenshots
Performance results
Cost analysis
GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository and push the markdown file along with any relevant code.
Example markdown structure:
markdown
Copy code
